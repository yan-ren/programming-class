Assessment Overview:

The assessment includes verbal questions and live coding exercises and will last approximately 45 minutes. The session will be recorded, and you will be asked to share your screen during the coding portion.
 
React / Frontend:
You should be comfortable with everyday React development. This includes managing component state with the commonly used hooks, understanding how React rerenders and how hooks behave during that process, and knowing when certain values should be derived rather than stored. You should be familiar with the performance-related tools React provides, as well as the general lifecycle of effects and how to handle resources within them. A basic understanding of techniques used to control high-frequency browser events is expected. You should also be able to load data inside a component using the Fetch API and use TypeScript with explicit types when writing UI logic.
 
Backend / Node:
You should understand how Node handles errors in different execution paths and be comfortable reasoning about backend behavior under uneven or spiky traffic. Familiarity with approaches to scaling services, including elastic compute options and their tradeoffs, is helpful. You should know the common authentication models used in web systems, general caching patterns that appear at the application layer, and the broad distinctions between modern API design styles. Awareness of different rendering models used across the web ecosystem is also expected.
