Kids are playing a game called Dodgeball. The game is played on a large playing field, each player standing in a different spot with integer coordinates.
The game starts with one player receiving a ball from one of the main eight compass directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW (listed in clockwise order).
Whenever a player gets the ball, he or she rotates clockwise in multiples of 45 degrees (starting with the next direction from which he or she has just received the ball), until they find another player standing in that exact direction. The player then throws the ball and leaves the field. If there are multiple players in the same direction, the ball always goes to the nearest one. Next player continues with this process and so the game goes on, until the player that received the ball doesn't have anybody else to throw the ball to.
The picture below shows how the game could go for similar starting positions of players but different
starting players and directions.

Task
You are given the initial description of the playing field and the players. Find out how many throws will the players make before the game ends. The first player receiving the ball doesn't count as a throw. Also find out which player is the last one to receive the ball.

Input description
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T ≤ 100. Description of T test cases follows.
Input for a single test case starts with a line containing a single integer N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000), number of players in the game.
Each of the following N lines contains two integers Xp Yp (-10^9 ≤ Xp, Yp ≤ 10^9), where Xp Yp are the coordinates of the pth player on the playing field.
The next line contains string D-direction the first player received the ball from. D is one of {N, E, S, W, NW, NE, SW, SE}. Vector (1, 1) points to NE.
The last line contains an integer $ (1 ≤ S ≤ N), index of the starting player.

Output description
For each test case, output one line containing two integers separated by a single space, the number of throws for the corresponding test case and number of the last player that held the ball.

Test Samples

In the folder there are two samples with input and output: example1.in, example1.out, example2.in, example2.out

For example1.in,
In the first test case the ball travels between players
with numbers 5→6→1→7→8
In the second test case the ball travels between players with numbers 4→3→5→2→1→6.
