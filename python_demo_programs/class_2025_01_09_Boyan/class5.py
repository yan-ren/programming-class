Boolean
'''
# a = True
# b = False
# print(type(a))
# print(type(b))

# boolean is generated as the result of comparison
# print(1 == 1)
# print(1 != 1)
# print(1 < 10)
# print(2 >= 10)
# print(1 < 2 < 3)

# boolean calculation
# a = False
# b = False
#
# # and: as long as one side is False, overall is False
# print(a and b)
#
# # or: as long as one side is True, overall is True
# print(a or b)
#
# # not: reverse
# print(not a)
#
# print((2 * 3.14) < 6 or (17.3 == 14))

# conditional: if statement
# number = int(input('Enter a number:'))

# if number > 100:
#     print('This number is bigger than 100')
# elif number > 10:
#     print('This number is bigger than 10')
# else:
#     print('Whatever')

# Practice: ask people for a number, check if it's even or odd
# number = int(input('Enter a number:'))
#
# if number % 2 == 0:
#     print('Even')
# else:
#     print('Odd')

Practice:
Ask user to enter three scores(integer), 
calculate the average score and tell user if average is above 60 included

# nested conditional / nested if statement
# a = 2
# if a > 0:
#     if a % 2 == 0:
#         print('Positive Even')
#     else:
#         print('Positive Odd')
# else:
#     print('Negative')

Ask user to type three integers, print the largest integer
